<UL style="margin-left:20px">
<LI><B>Priority</b></LI><br>
You can change the base priority of a process with this submenu. When you change the base priority of a process the system adjusts the priorities of threads within the process so that they remain at the same relative priority with respect to the new base priority.
<br><br>
<LI><B>Launch Depends</b></LI><br>
If PROWiSe Manager finds the <a onclick="SwHdPopup(depwlkrPopup)" href="#ShowPopupTip">Dependency Walker</a> tool, it will be opened with the selected process as the argument.
<br>
<span class="PopupText" id="depwlkrPopup">* The Dependency Walker tool shows static DLL dependencies. (see http://www.dependencywalker.com)</span>
<br>
<LI><B>Suspend</b></LI><br>
If you want a process to become temporarily inactive, so that a system resource such as network, CPU or disk, becomes available for other processes, you can suspend the process. To resume a suspended process chose the <b>Resume</b> item from the process context menu.<br>
<b style="color:blue">*</b> Suspended processes show in a dark grey color.
<br><br>
<LI><B>Kill process</b></LI><br>
This item terminates a process with the Terminate Process API. Note that a process terminated in this way is not warned of its termination and therefore does not write unsaved data it may have.
<br><br>
<P><B>Important!</B> Be careful when ending a process. If you end a system service, some part of the system might not function properly.</P>
<LI><B>Properties</b></LI><br>
This selection opens a property dialog that shows you more information about a process.
