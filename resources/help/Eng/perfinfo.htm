<P>The <B>Performance</B> tab displays a dynamic overview of your computer's performance.</P>
<UL style="margin-left:20px">
<LI><B>CPU Usage</b></LI><br>
A graph indicating the percentage of time the processor is working. This counter is a primary indicator of processor activity. View this graph to see how much processing time you are using.
If this graph displays a high percentage, it means that one or more processes are use many cpu time. In this case your computer may running slowly.
<br><br>
<LI><B>CPU Usage History</b></LI><br>
A graph showing how busy the CPU has been over time.
The sampling displayed in the graph depends on the value you select for the <i>Update Speed</i> on the <i>View</i> menu.
<br><br>
<LI><B>Memory Usage</b></LI><br>
<UL style="margin-left:20px;">
 <LI><B>Commit</b></LI><br>
 A graph showing commit charge. When committed virtual memory, reaches the system Commit Limit, applications and the system become unstable. The <b>Commit Limit</b> is the sum of most of physical memory and the sizes of any paging files.
 <LI><B>RAM Usage</b></LI><br>
 A graph showing physical memory usage.
</ul><br>
<LI><B>Totals for the number of <a onclick="SwHdPopup(handlePopup)" href="#ShowPopupTip">handles</a>, <a onclick="SwHdPopup(threadPopup)" href="#ShowPopupTip">threads</a> è <a onclick="SwHdPopup(processPopup)" href="#ShowPopupTip">processes</a>, running on the computer.</b></LI>
<br>
<span class="PopupText" id="handlePopup">* Handle - a value used to uniquely identify a resource, such as a file or registry key, so that a program can access it.</span>
<span class="PopupText" id="threadPopup">* Thread - an object within a process that runs program instructions. Threads allow concurrent operations within a process and enable one process to run different parts of its program on different processors simultaneously.</span>
<span class="PopupText" id="processPopup">* Process - an executable program, such as Windows Explorer, or a service.</span>
<br>
<LI><B><a onclick="SwHdPopup(ramPopup)" href="#ShowPopupTip">Physical Memory</a> (Kb).</b></LI><br>
<span class="PopupText" id="ramPopup">* Physical Memory (also called RAM) - memory installed on your computer. Information stored in RAM is lost when the computer is turned off.</span>
<B>Available</b> represents the amount of free memory that is available for use.<br>
The <B>System Cache</b> shows the current physical memory used to map pages of open files.<br>
<br>
<LI><B><a onclick="SwHdPopup(kernmemPopup)" href="#ShowPopupTip">Kernel Memory</a> (Kb).</b></LI><br>
<span class="PopupText" id="kernmemPopup">* Kernel Memory - memory used by the operating system kernel and device drivers.</span>
<B>Paged</b> is memory that can be copied to the paging file, thereby freeing the physical memory. The physical memory can then be used by the operating system.<br>
<B>Nonpaged</b> is memory that remains resident in physical memory and will not be copied out to the paging file.
<br><br>
<LI><B>Commit Charge (Kb).</b></LI><br>
Memory allocated to programs and the operating system. Because of memory copied to the paging file, called virtual memory, the value listed under <b>Peak</b> may exceed the maximum physical memory.
<br><br>
<LI><B>Memory page size and allocation granularity (Kb).</b></LI><br>
Allocation granularity specifies the granularity with which virtual memory is allocated.
