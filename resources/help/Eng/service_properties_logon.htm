<H2>Service Properties: Load And Logon<hr></H2>
<UL style="margin-left:20px">
<LI><B>LogOn</b></LI><br>
Specifies an Account (User Name) under which a service will run.<br><br>
<ul style="margin-left:20px">
<li><B>LocalSystem</b><br>
This account is not recognized by the security subsystem. It has extensive privileges on the local computer, and acts as the computer on the network. Its token includes the <em>NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM</em> and <em>BUILTIN\Administrators</em> security identifiers; these accounts have access to most system objects.<br>
The account is not associated with any logged-on user account. This has several implications:<br>
- The registry key <em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</em> is associated with the default user, not the current user;<br>
- The service can open the registry key <em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY</em>;<br>
- The service presents the computer's credentials to remote servers;<br>
- If the service opens a command window and runs a batch file, the user could hit CTRL+C to terminate the batch file and gain access to a command window with LocalSystem permissions;<br>
<ul style="margin-left:20px">
 <li><B>Allow service to interact with desktop</b><br>
 Enable this check box to allow the service to display a user interface and receive user input.<br>
 Typically, services are console applications that are designed to run unattended without a graphical user interface (GUI). However, some services may require occasional interaction with a user.<br>
 However, note that the following registry key contains a value <em>NoInteractiveServices</em>: <em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Windows</em>. The <em>NoInteractiveServices</em> value defaults to 0 (zero), which means that services are allowed to run interactively. When <em>NoInteractiveServices</em> is set to a nonzero value, no service started thereafter is allowed to run interactively.
 </ul>
</ul>
<br>
<LI><B>Load-Order Group</b></LI><br>
Information of an load ordering group of which this service is a member. If the field is disabled, the service does not belong to a group.<br><br>
<ul>
<li><B>Name</b><br>
The name of the group.
<br><br>
<LI><B>Tag in group</b></LI><br>
A unique tag value for this service in the group.
Tag can be used for ordering service startup in a load ordering group by specifying a tag order vector in the registry located at: <em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GroupOrderList</em><br>
Tags are only evaluated for Drivers that have Boot or System start types.
</ul>
<br>
<LI><B>[View Group]</b></LI><br>
Opens a dialog box that contains list of all members of this group.
<br><br>
