PROWiSe Manager is an advanced management utility. It will show you detailed information about processes and services running on computer.
<br><br>
As a processes manager, it shows the icon, command-line, full image path, memory statistics, user account and more. You can list the DLLs the process has loaded or the operating system resource handles it has open. Also you can see the status of the programs that are running and end programs that have stopped responding.
<br><br>
As a services manager, it shows information about all registered services. You can change status and startup type of the service as well as disable it. Also you can remove a service and delete executable file associated with it.
<br><br>
As a performance monitor, it shows global system performance metrics like those shown in Task Manager. The information includes the amount of committed and available virtual and physical memory as well as paged and nonpaged kernel buffer usage.
