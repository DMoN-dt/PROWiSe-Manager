<H2>Process Properties<hr></H2>
You can view additional details for a process by selecting it and using the <b>Process->Properties</b> menu item or the context menu.
Any dynamic data, such as performance information, updates at the refresh rate currently selected for PROWiSe Manager. You can manually refresh dynamic information by typing F5 in a page.
<UL style="margin-left:20px">
<LI><B>Process identifier (ID)</b></LI><br>
A numerical identifier that uniquely distinguishes a <a onclick="SwHdPopup(processPopup)" href="#ShowPopupTip">process</a> while it runs. ID Process numbers are reused, so they only identify a process for the lifetime of that process.<br>
<span class="PopupText" id="processPopup">* Process - an executable program, such as Windows Explorer.</span>
<br>
<LI><B>Parent process ID (Ð.ID)</b></LI><br>
Process identifier of the process created this one.
<br><br>
<LI><B>CPU Time</b></LI><br>
The total processor time, in seconds, used by a process since it started.
<br><br>
<LI><B>CPU Usage</b></LI><br>
The percentage of time that a process used the CPU since the last update.
<br><br>
<LI><B>User Name</b></LI><br>
The name of the user whose session owns the process.
<br><br>
<LI><B>Base Priority</b></LI><br>
A precedence ranking that determines the order in which the threads of a process are scheduled for the processor. Use PROWiSe Manager to view and change base priorities.
<br><br>
<LI><B>Handle Count</b></LI><br>
The total number of <a onclick="SwHdPopup(handlePopup)" href="#ShowPopupTip">handles</a> currently open by this process. This number is the sum of the handles currently open by each thread in this process.
<br>
<span class="PopupText" id="handlePopup">* Handle - a value used to uniquely identify a resource, such as a file or registry key, so that a program can access it.</span>
<br>
<LI><B>Thread Count</b></LI><br>
The number of <a onclick="SwHdPopup(threadPopup)" href="#ShowPopupTip">threads</a> running in a process.<br>
<span class="PopupText" id="threadPopup">* Thread - an object within a process that runs program instructions. Threads allow concurrent operations within a process and enable one process to run different parts of its program on different processors simultaneously.</span>
<br>
<LI><B>Session ID</b></LI><br>
The session ID that owns the process.
<br><br>
<LI><B>Commit Charge</b></LI><br>
Memory allocated to process.
<br><br>
<LI><B>Working Set</b></LI><br>
The current number of bytes in the working set of this process. The working set of a program is a collection of those pages in its virtual address space that have been recently referenced. It includes both shared and private data. The shared data includes pages that contain all instructions the application executes, including those in DLLs. As the working set size increases, memory demand increases.
<br><br>
<LI><B>Private Bytes</b></LI><br>
The current number of bytes this process has allocated that cannot be shared with other processes.
<br><br>
<LI><B>VM Size</b></LI><br>
The current size of the virtual address space the process is using. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages.
<br><br>
<LI><B>Context Switch</b></LI><br>
The system scheduler maintains a queue of executable threads for each priority level. When a processor becomes available, the system performs a <a onclick="SwHdPopup(contextPopup)" href="#ShowPopupTip">context</a> switch. The steps in a context switch are:<br>
<span class="PopupText" id="contextPopup">* Context - a structure that contains processor-specific register data. Windows uses it to perform various internal operations.<br></span>
1. Save the context of the thread that just finished executing.<br>
2. Place the thread that just finished executing at the end of the queue for its priority.<br>
3. Find the highest priority queue that contains ready threads.<br>
4. Remove the thread at the head of the queue, load its context, and execute it.<br><br>
The most common reasons for a context switch are:<br>
1. The time slice has elapsed.<br>
2. A thread with a higher priority has become ready to run.<br>
3. A running thread needs to wait.
<br><br>
<LI><B>CSw Delta</b></LI><br>
Context Switch Delta since the last update.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<LI><B>Time Stamp</b></LI><br>
The time stamp for an image indicates the date and time that the image was created by the linker. The value is represented in Universal Coordinated Time.
