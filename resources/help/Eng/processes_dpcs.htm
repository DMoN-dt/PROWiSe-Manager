<H2>Interrupts and DPCs<hr></H2>
<P>PROWiSe Manager shows two artificial processes: Interrupts and DPCs. These processes reflect the amount of time the system spends servicing hardware interrupts and Deferred Procedure Calls (DPCs), respectively. High CPU consumption by these activities can indicate a hardware problem or device driver bug. To see the total number of interrupts and DPCs executed since the system booted add the <i>Context Switch</i> column. Another sometimes useful metric is the number of interrupts and DPCs generated per refresh interval, which you see when you add the <i>CSw Delta</i> column.</P>
